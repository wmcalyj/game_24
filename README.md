# 24 Game (24ç‚¹)

This is a card game I used to play a lot when I was a child. I created an Android version so I can play it even without a deck of cards with me. The user can choose to enter 4 number manually and check to see if it has a way to get 24 or the user can choose to receive 4 random number and try to compute 24.
